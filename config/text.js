    Inspirable was born out of a strong desire to revolutionise the reading
    experience for children. By designing an application that puts each reader into
    our carefully crafted stories, we want to inspire children to read widely, relate
    clearly and comprehend fully. We are focused on helping children foster a love
    for reading through our innovative approach that ensures stories are relevant,
    engaging and dynamic. Driven by a dedication to give back to children and
    society, we are rolling up our sleeves and diving into the details to ensure each
    story becomes an opportunity for a curious child to learn, grow and expand his/
    her imagination.`

const pressAboutInspirableText2 = `
    We want to breathe new life into children's education by delivering well-
    conceptulised stories that are memorable, educational and fun to read. For
    children who struggle to remain attentive or for those who love finding new joys
    of reading and learning, inspiratble is the perfect tool. After thorough research
    and consideration, we have focused our effortson adding real value to stories
    that serve to aid in a child's balanced growth and development. By having the
    main character in each story personalised in some way is the first step in the
    transformation of the reading experience for children. That said, we want the
    reading (your child) to become part of the story so that they can better
    comprehend the messaging and commit it to memory. Our commitment to
    cultivating a rich and inclusive environment for learning and development will
    always remain paramount to our company's purpose.`

const pressAboutInspirableText3 = `
    Inspirable is an innovative company, driven by our passion to help children see
